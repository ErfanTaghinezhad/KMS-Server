# KMS-Server
# Setting up the KMS-activation server:
A KMS (Key Management Service) server is a software service provided by Microsoft for activating Microsoft software products, especially Windows and Office. This service runs within your organizational network (usually LAN) and helps various clients on the network to automatically activate Windows and Office without the need to enter product keys manually.

In essence, the KMS Server is responsible for managing product keys of software products, and clients within the network can utilize this service to activate products automatically without the need for manual product key entry.
